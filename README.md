# movie_app

An app that allows users to "like" movies pulled from a database by swiping them right
Liked movies are stored in a list in the backend when both are running

## Getting Started
1. Ensure that you have an Android emulator (installed via Android Studio) ready to go
2. Turn on the backend locally (separate repository)
3. Run the app with `flutter run`, choose the currently running Android emulator if prompted
4. Test out the app by swiping movies left or right, keeping an eye on the backend console, changing the username and repeating!
